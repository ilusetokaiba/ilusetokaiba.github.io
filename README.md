<p> Hi, my name is Corly. 
<p> I'm a technical artist with a focus in making tools. </p>
<p> I graduated from University of California San Diego with a BA in Interdisciplinary Computing and Media, which had a very object oriented programming curriculum. </p>
<p> Currently, I am a student at Gnomon learning more about 3D software and how I can use programming to make using them easier </p>
